# What is this?
This is a really basic base framework I've created so I can kick start projects a bit quicker.
It's easily modifiable to how/what ever you need to do with it.
This is powering my site, [tyler.ac](https://tyler.ac).

## Installation
A quick, pretty easy guide:
1. Clone/download and navigate to that directory
2. Run `composer install` and `npm install` in your terminal
3. In `/App/` copy `Config.sample.php` to `Config.php` and fill with your env details
4. ???
5. You should be up and running

## Support
I'll update this repo whenever I change or fix something but other than that it'll be slim.

## Contributing
Please feel free to add or change anything, I know there's aspects what are total crap or need fixing and I will get around to doing so at some point.
